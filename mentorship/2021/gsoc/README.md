1. ### GraphiQL 2.0 Architectural Proposal (proposed by @acao) & GraphiQL Plugins (Medium)

**Develop a robust ecosystem for web based GraphiQL, also to develop the plugins for GraphiQL.**

GraphiQL is introducing a new [architectural proposal](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/discussions/1787) for 2.0 and a new plugin system that will allow users to extend and customize the GraphQL development experience substantially. Using these new interfaces, users can choose from a list of proposed plugins that users have asked for and specs, and execute and iterate on them. They can be anything from viewing results in a map, to schema explorer features, as well as new commands and code actions.


**Expected outcomes**

* Introduce the new ecosystem based on [Architecural Proposal](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/discussions/1787).
* Introduce Pull Requests for plugins, potentially finish and publish some within the time frame.

**Skills required/preferred**

* React
* Typescript

**Mentors**

* [mentor name]
* [mentor name]
* ...
